title: Machine learning, drones, and whales: A great combination!
---

It's been a long time since I've posted anything about what I'm actually working
on. These days, it's a variety of things at the intersection of mathematics,
computing, and biology. One of them is a project to help track the health of
whale populations by using machine learning to analyze video from drones. 
This is a project that began when [Parley for the Oceans](https://parley.tv) 
introduced me and my colleagues Ted Willke and Javier Turek to Dr. Iain Kerr of
[Ocean Alliance](https://www.whale.org), and we started talking about how 
machine learning could help make marine biologists' lives easier and help 
protect the whales, using the video from Dr. Kerr's *SnotBot* drones.
