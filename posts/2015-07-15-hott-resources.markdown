title: Higher Order Type Theory Resources
---

Recently there's been an outpouring of useful resources folks have found for
learning Homotopy Type Theory (aka HoTT). These have come mainly from the
HoTT Cafe Google Group. 

The main resource is of course, the
[book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/), but these videos and other
resources seem useful enough that I want a consolidated list of them for
myself.  So I thought maybe you might, too.

Group threads that provided these links:

* [Long way to the HoTT book](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hott-cafe/VHzQWyYbXt0)
* [HoTT without homotopy?](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hott-cafe/7zN3y0oSKq4)
* [Robert Harper's HoTT course at CMU](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hott-cafe/kZMjhzFnzHE)

_Note_ that I'm likely to update this page in the future with other resources
as I find them, and those links may or may not come from the Groups threads 
just mentioned.

Useful resources, in no particular order:

* [Univalence as a new Principle of Logic](http://www.mathtube.org/lecture/video/univalence-new-principle-logic) - recommended by one writer as perhaps the first video to watch
* [Wadler's Propositions as Types paper](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf) - recommended by one writer as a good pairing with chapter 1 of the hott book.
* [Robert Harper's 15-819 Homotopy Type Theory](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/courses/hott/)([videos](http://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=07756bb0-b872-4a4a-95b1-b77ad206dab3)
* [Awodey's Category Theory book](http://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182)
* [Awodey's Category Theory lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF6kHD1DAeU) (URL is to first video, it's a series)
* [Bristol HoTT project](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/research/projects/homotopy-type-theory/)
